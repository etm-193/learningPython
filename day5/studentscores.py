# the course is asking for me to replicate the max function for the scores that are input as a list using a for loop.
# In other words they want us to check each value and compare to see which one is higher.

# highest_score = 0

# for score in student_scores:
#     if score > highest_score:
#         highest_score = score

# print(f" the highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")

# truns out you can use if statements within for loops

#for loops with range operators

#  for number in range(a, b):
#       print(number)
total = 0
for number in range (1, 101):
    total += number
print(total)
