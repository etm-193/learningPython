# Python Variables

name = input("What is your name?")
print(name)

# Like other programming languages and scripting languages going from top to bottom executing code first we create a variable the variable can be a method or an object:

sayTheName = input("What was your name again?")
length = len(name)
# then these two variables come together like so:
print(length)
#sayTheName variable asks for the input method stored inside then length uses the len command/method to examine the sayTheName variable which = input
