# Mathematical operators

from __future__ import division
from doctest import Example


addition = 3 + 2
subtraction = 5 - 1
multiplication = 9 * 2
division = 4 / 2
exponent = 2 ** 2


# like manual math there are rules as to the order of math : pemdas -   PARENTHESIS, exponent, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction:

Example = 3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3

# left to right thats the way to go (program to see code execute step by step is called thony)
