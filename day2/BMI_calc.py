# BMI calculator

# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight. The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# Meters to feet : for an approximate result, multiply the length value by 3.281  so... to get the inverse divide?

print("Welcome to the BMI Calculator")

height = input("Enter your height in Feet: ")

height_feet = float(height)

height_meters = height_feet / 3.281

print(height_meters)

weight = input("Enter your weight in Lbs: ")

# for an approximate result, divide the mass value by 2.205

weight_kgs = int(weight) / 2.205

print(weight_kgs)

bmi = weight_kgs / height_meters ** 2

results = str(bmi)

print("Your Body mass indicator is: " + results)

# this was the exercise and the solution... I just got a little creative and complicated it by converting my weight and height data into metric vs imperial:

# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# height = input("enter your height in m: ")
# weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# weight_kgs = float(weight)

# height_meters = float(height)

# bmi = weight_kgs / height_meters ** 2

# results = int(bmi)

# print(results)

# took me a while because they wanted the result of the bmi as a whole number and i was presenting it as a float/string as soon as I changed my results to = int i passed the exercise.
