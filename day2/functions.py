# Understanding Functions

# think a machine that turns potatoes as fries if you put something other than poatoes it will come back as an error... ex len(1234) = type_error

from cmath import log


num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))

# type conversion or casting

print(type(len(input("What is your name?"))))

new_num_char = str(num_char)

print = ("Your name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")

# javaScript has slightly different syntax but the theory and application behind it is the same.
