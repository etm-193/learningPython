# Creating a hangman game!
print("Welcome lets play some hangman")
# The hang man game is simple in real life a person chooses a word for the other to guess.
# The player/guesser guesses (lol) one letter at a time.
# The player has 5 chances, each failed attempt triggers a body part to be drawn
# head, torso, arm, arm, leg, leg, and thats game over. 
# If they complete the word within those chances they win.
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Program logic:
# A string needs to be randomly selected from a list 
# the len of the word needs to be determined
