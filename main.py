print("Hello World")
# This is the iconic first step, by using the comand print ("") we have just printed a string. Now this syntax looks very similar to java. I guess later my hypothesis confirmed or not.

print("")

print("Learning Concatenation")

print("concatenation is created using the the '+' sign")

# print("e.g. print('Hello' + 'world')"\n"New lines can be created with baslash and n" ) this was my first attempt at using this method and i made the mistake of splitting the statement and inserting the command in between two separate statements (which I'm not sure could have even been called separate as there was no coma or other symbol) the correct way is as follows:

print("e.g. print('Hello' + 'world')\nNew lines can be created with baslash and n" )
